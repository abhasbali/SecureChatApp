# SecureChatApp

SecureChatApp is a secure chat application built using Python that ensures confidentiality and integrity of communication between users through end-to-end encryption.

## Features

- **End-to-End Encryption:** Messages exchanged between users are encrypted on the sender's device and decrypted on the recipient's device, ensuring that only the intended recipient can read the message.
- **User Authentication:** Users are authenticated using strong cryptographic protocols to prevent unauthorized access to the chat application.
- **User Interface:** The application provides an intuitive user interface for sending and receiving encrypted messages, managing contacts, and viewing chat history.
- **Multi-Platform Support:** SecureChatApp supports multiple platforms, allowing users to securely communicate across desktop and mobile devices.
